My own vector without templates. This one works with only one defined type of data.
You can find upgraded project with templates in my repository "Track_autumn" 

I've realized some things:

1)Copying and assignation constructors using deep copying

2)Weird move semantics

3)Reloaded operators of input, output and so on
